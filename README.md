# C++ kRPC Client installer for windows

This is a simple script to install the C++ kRPC client on windows. It downloads the latest release from the kRPC github page and installs it using CMake and Ninja.

## Requirements

- Git
- CMake
- A C++ compiler (MSVC, GCC, Clang, etc.)

## Usage

1. Make sure you have git, cmake and a C++ compiler installed and in your PATH
2. Clone or download this repository, it has the scripts and the modified CMakeLists.txt to use vcpkg's toolchain file
3. Run powershell and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the repository
4. Run the script `.\configure.ps1`, this will download the latest release of the kRPC client and configure the environment for building the project
5. Run the script `.\build.ps1`, this will build the project using cmake and ninja, and install the library in the %appdata%\kRPC folder
6. You can now delete this folder, the kRPC client is installed in the %appdata%\kRPC folder.
7. You can now use the library in your projects by including the headers and linking the library with your project.

# Important

To use kRPC in your project you need to add the %appdata%\kRPC\krpc.pb.cpp as a source file in your project, this file is generated by the build script and contains the protobuf generated code.

I am not affiliated with the kRPC project, nor do I own any of the code in the kRPC repository. This script is just a helper to install the kRPC client on windows, all the credit goes to the kRPC developers. Use at your own risk.
